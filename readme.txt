What it does
Welcome to Weather3. Weather 3 is an app that converts any temperature to Celcius or Farenheit. Simply type in the temperature and click the button to switch to your preferred unit. Planning a trip to London? Dont forget to check the weather. This useful pocket app will help you know whether to bring your winter coat or your sandals on your trip. Unfamiliar with the metric unit Celcius? Dont feel like doing math to convert to Farenheit? With Weather3, you'll never have to wonder what the temperature really is.

The app reads the user input, a temperature, and converts it to the alternate temperature unit. For various temperature ranges, the floating action says a related message. I got the idea from not knowing what temperature ranges in celcius compared to in farenheit.

On Aug.29 I brainstormed things to convert. 
On Aug.31 I experimented with some xml ideas and drew out some ui designs. I used the nexus emulator and edited xml with text views and fonts. 
On Sep.2 Decided on weather app. Added more textviews, strings, organized layouts and added a textstatechange so it would automatically convert after editing.
On Sep.4 Used button instead for converting. I added tabs, and changed the name, it created an issue with missing module when building the app
On Sep.6 I tried out tab fragment activity but didnt need them, edited ids and linked them with mainactivity
On Sep.7 I fixed string resource warnings, added conversion functions, used the pixel 2 emulator
On Sep.8 I added colors and images, and added a floating action button
