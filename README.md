# Program1_UnitConverter

*******trouble commiting entire final app on this repository so actual final project is at https://github.com/kjones47/Weather3

Welcome to Weather3. Weather3 is an app that converts any temperature to Celcius or Farenheit. Simply type in the temperature and click the button to switch to your preferred unit. Planning a trip to London? Dont forget to check the weather. This useful pocket app will help you know whether to bring your winter coat or your sandals on your trip. Unfamiliar with the metric unit Celcius? Dont feel like doing math to convert to Farenheit? With Weather3, you'll never have to wonder what the temperature really is.

The app reads the user input, a temperature, and converts it to the alternate temperature unit. For various temperature ranges, the floating action button says a related message. I got the idea from not knowing what temperature ranges in celcius compare to in farenheit.

On Aug.29 Brainstormed things to convert
On Aug.31 Experimented with some xml ideas and drew out some ui designs. Used the nexus emulator and edited xml with text views and fonts. 
On Sep.2 Decided on weatherApp. Added more textviews, strings, organized layouts and added a textstatechange so it would automatically convert after editing.
On Sep.4 Used button instead for converting. Added 2 tabs, and changed the project name, an issue with missing module when building the app so created new project Weather2
On Sep.6 Tried out tab fragment activity but didnt need them, edited ids and linked them with mainactivity, created path/module/build issues when moving Weather2 to this repo 
On Sep.7 Fixed string resource warnings, added conversion functions, used the pixel 2 emulator
On Sep.8 Added colors and images, and added a floating action button, learned how to upload whole project android studio and connected git to android studio. Moved to new project Weather3 because I couldnt get commits working on this repo; uploaded it there. Will connect android studio to git first for future projects
